/**
 * This program will take integers between 13 and 100 from the user. For each entry, the program will 
 * create a list of integers between 1 and the given integer. It will then find the lowest integer that,
 * when added to itself, will loop through the entire list of integers and reach the number 13 last. The
 * integer being added to itself will continuously wrap around the list of integers to always create a 
 * number between 1 and the given number that has not been landed on yet.
